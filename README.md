# 🌠 welcome to my GitHub ^_^

This space is for cybersecurity engineering, open-source threat intelligence, and research + exploration.  
I am always open to collaboration across galaxies.

my background: 🛸 Threat Detection Engineering | Geopolitical Risk | SOAR + Security Automation | 🛰 OSINT + threat research

projects here combine logic, data, Python-based detection, automation scripts, and real-world edge — often with a visual twist. ✨
